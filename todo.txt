Long Term:
1. Figure out basics of how React works with the HTML and the React DOM
2. Learn how to sqlite with node (DONE)
3. Implement token authentication when user wants to do anything (mostly withdraw chips or play)
4. Figure out a way to reduce the number of db calls overall

Important Tips:
1. Localstorage and Sessionstorage can be edited manually. You need to hash.
2. Promises are not rejected unless the returned promise value is read. (pretty sure)
3. Know the difference between encoding and hashing. I should hash the login token, but i should encode the number of chips stored in local storage.
