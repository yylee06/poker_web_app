Short Term: 
    see how often playerslots re-renders during a game, big chance for optimization here through memoization
        -can use memo to reduce renders, likely useable in playerslots.js

    do more testing w/ 2 and 3 players, closed-circuit (i.e. chips are known)
        -2 players
        -3 players

    last action, calling does not show chips
        -fixed?
    split pots messed up
        -fixed?




Bugs:


Possible Future Ideas:
1. Figure out how to highlight actions one can take, and gray out invalid options
2. add toggle functions to actions (fold, call, check)
3. Add text-splitting capabilities to the chatbox, so that longer messages can be sent.

Important Tips:
1. Localstorage and Sessionstorage can be edited manually. You need to hash.
2. Promises are not rejected unless the returned promise value is read. (pretty sure)
3. Know the difference between encoding and hashing. I should hash the login token, but i should encode things stored in local storage.
